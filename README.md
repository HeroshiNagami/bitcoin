IsleCoin Core Tree
=====================================

What is IsleCoin?
----------------

IsleCoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world and specifically for the Caribbean. IsleCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. IsleCoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
